history.part1=History of the Department of information technologies of automated systems (ITAS)
history.part2=The ITAS Department was established in 1964 by order of the Ministry of higher, secondary special and professional education of the BSSR N 350 from 27.05.1964 as the Department of automatic control Systems (ACS). The purpose of opening the Department was the need to train engineers in the specialty "Automation and telemechanics", able to solve industrial problems and provide scientific and technical progress in the field of automatic control systems, control and telemechanics. The first teaching staff of the Department in 1964/65. the year, consisting of five people, was approved by the order of the Minsk radio engineering Institute on July 1, 1964: head of the Department, Ph. D., associate Professor Borovoy B. V., Ph. D., associate Professor Hutsky G. I., associate Professor Zhuravlev V. F., assistant Sinyakov A. L., assistant strigalev L. S. The scientific work performed at the Department in the first year of its existence was the development of self-adjusting devices for controlling the Belarusian power system (Ph. D., associate Professor Borovoy B. V.), scientific management of the creation of control computers for regulating processes at power plants of the BSSR (Ph. D., associate Professor Hutsky G. I.), development of the design and theory of an automatic controller of synchronous generators with permanent magnets (assistant Sinyakov A. L.).
history.part3=In 1965, the head of the Department was appointed senior lecturer Tokarev Igor Ivanovich. At the initiative of I. I. Tokarev, the Department of ACS began to indicate a trend of gradual re-profiling of the Department of ACS from the tasks of automatic control of technical objects to the tasks of organizational and economic management. In 1969, Valery Olegovich Chernyshev, Ph. D., associate Professor, became the head of the Department. he completed post-graduate studies at the V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Leningrad electrotechnical Institute (LETI) and later defended his doctoral dissertation in 1973. The trend of repurposing the Department was continued. When the directives of the XXIV Congress of the CPSU on the five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1971 - In 1975, for the first time, the task was set to "develop and implement automated systems for planning and management of industries, territorial organizations, associations, enterprises, meaning to create a national system for collecting and processing information for accounting, planning and management of the national economy on the basis of the state network of computer centers and a unified automated communication network of the country" (newspaper "Pravda" from April 11, 1971), the Department of ACS was the most prepared to solve these problems. By order of the Ministry of higher, secondary special and professional education of the BSSR N 399 of 21.06.1971, the Department of ACS was renamed the Department of Automated control systems (ACS) and in the 1971/72 academic year began training students in a new specialty "Automated control systems". Although the Department was preparing for such changes, "it took a lot of effort on the part of both students and employees of the Department" (from the report of the Department for 1971/72 academic year). as the head of the Department (1969 - 1973), the material and technical training base of the Department was created. In accordance with the requirements of the Higher school at a high scientific and technical level, the educational process was organized in all disciplines of the curriculum, which was supported by significant methodological work. The implementation of diploma projects using computers has begun. Special attention was paid to conducting scientific research in the framework of state budget and contract subjects, publishing the results in periodicals. A great contribution to the formation of the Department was made by the candidate of technical Sciences, associate Professor Lev Trubetskov, who was the Deputy head of the Department.
history.part4=At the end of 1973, he was appointed head of the Department. the Department of ACS was elected doctor of technical Sciences, prof. Smolnikov, who previously worked as a Professor at the Department of Automation and telemechanics of the Leningrad electrotechnical Institute (LETI, now SPbGETU). By this time, the Department of ACS has already developed a fairly strong team of capable young teachers who have successfully graduated from MRTI. Revotyuk M. P., a graduate of the Department, proposed and implemented the idea of organizing laboratory work for students of the Department on the basis of the EC-1020 CVM in the Institute's VC. In the 1973/74 academic year, for the first time all diploma projects were performed using a computer. Subsequently, the widespread use of CMC in course and diploma design increased the number of diploma projects implemented in production to 95%. The scientific and methodological level of teaching was quite high, but there were not enough teachers with academic degrees. This was partly due to the absence of a dissertation Council in the MRTI. A few years later, thanks to the efforts of the rector of MRTI, V. M. Ilyin, such a Council was created. V. M. Ilyin was appointed Chairman of the Council, and L. p. Smolnikov was appointed Deputy Chairman. The creation of the defense Council was an important event for MRTI, which contributed to the replenishment of the teaching staff of the ACS Department and other departments of the Institute with specialists with academic degrees. Long trips abroad of young teachers (Svirin Yu.P. - France, Smorodinsky S. S. - Germany) were useful for the Department. Teachers of the Department in 1973 - 1977 published 30 works, including a monograph (publishing house "Energy") and a textbook (publishing house " Higher school\u00BB) Smolnikova L. P. in 1974 defended their candidate's dissertations assistants Mukha V. S. and Smorodinsky S. S. in 1979 Smolnikov L. P. was awarded the diploma of the Supreme Soviet of the BSSR, which can be regarded as a positive assessment of the work of the staff of the Department of automated control systems as a whole.
history.part5=In 1976, MRTI opened a new Department of Computational methods and programming (Vmip), designed to provide training for students of all specialties in such areas as computer programming, computational methods, probability theory, and discrete mathematics. The Department of ACS can be considered to be the parent of this Department, as a significant part of teachers of the Department of ACS was transferred to a new Department (Ph. D., associate Professor Kolotygin E. S., Ph. D., associate Professor Brezhnev B. P., Ph. D., associate Professor Ptichkin V. A., assistant Mukha V. S.), and head of the Department of Vmep was appointed PhD, associate Professor her son Vladimir Alekseevich.
history.part6=From 1980 to 1986, head of the ACS Department was doctor of technical Sciences, Professor Smirnov Anatoly Ivanovich, worked as a head of Department of automated control systems for Moscow construction engineering Institute. V. V. Kuibyshev. At this time, new areas of work of the Department are being formed, related to improving the reliability and efficiency of automated enterprise management systems, work is being done on PhD theses, and the writing of doctoral theses by associate professors of the Department is being stimulated.
history.part7=From 1986 to 1997, the head of the Department of ACS was Vladimir Ptichkin, who by that time (in 1981) had defended his doctoral dissertation. At this time, the Department, as well as all previous years, conducted a large educational, methodological, pedagogical and research work. In 1994, the Department of automated control systems was renamed the Department Of information technology of automated systems (ITAS). The Department began to produce engineers specializing in "Automated information processing and management systems". Methodological work since 1991 for at least five years has been aimed at a radical revision of existing curricula, programs, and even the list of specialties and specializations. In essence, the curriculum of the specialty "Automated information processing systems" was created, based on the curriculum of the specialty "Automated control systems", but not repeating it. The research work of the Department was conducted in two directions: production automation and reliability of systems. The latter direction has produced results not only in the form of completed contractual works, monographs and articles in peer-reviewed publications, but also in the training of highly qualified personnel. In 1987, associate Professor Alexey N. Smirnov at the Leningrad electrotechnical Institute (LETI) and in 1993, associate Professor Vyacheslav V. Mazanik at the Moscow Institute of engineering and physics (MEPhI) defended their doctoral dissertations.
history.part8=In 1997, the ITAS Department became a part of the Department of Intelligent information technologies (IIT), which combines two departments: ITAS and Intelligent systems. The Department of IIT began to produce engineers specializing in "Automated information processing systems". The head of the joint Department was appointed doctor of technical Sciences, Professor Vladimir Golenkov.
history.part9=In 1999, the IIT Department was divided into two departments: IIT and ITAS. After the revival, the ITAS Department continued to graduate engineers in the specialty "Automated information processing systems". The head of the ITAS Department was appointed doctor of technical Sciences, Professor Vladimir Mukha. We continued to improve the specialty of asoi, educational and methodological support, training of postgraduates, improving the material and technical base, and developing research work. The repair facilities of the Department, the laboratories are equipped with modern hardware and advanced software is used, the magistracy, in addition to its specialization Automated systems of processing and displaying information introduced a new specialization Internet technology, introduced distance learning. In 2012, the Department started teaching foreign students in English on the specialty Automated systems for processing and displaying information. In July 2013, the head of the Department was appointed Ph. D., associate Professor Navrotsky Anatoly Alexandrovich, and in September 2013 began training students on the program of four-year education at the first stage of higher education.
history.part10=Many graduates of the Department are currently working fruitfully at the University. Is doctor of technical Sciences, Professor, rector of BSUIR Batura M. P. (issue of 1975), Ph. D., associate Professor, BSUIR Vice-rector for academic Affairs and quality management Zhivitskaya E. N. (issue 1988); Ph.
